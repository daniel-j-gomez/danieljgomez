								<b>Project II: Deciphering Neuropathogenesis in Neurodegeneration, Cancer, and Infectious Diseases: Pioneering Novel Therapeutics and Diagnostics</b><br>
								<u>Theme</u>: Time-Resolved Structural Analysis and Advanced Imaging Techniques for Disease Investigation and Therapeutic Development<br>
								<u>Summary</u>: In line with my research interests in structural biology and medicine, this multifaceted project focuses on employing state-of-the-art techniques, such as time-resolved x-ray crystallography and cryogenic tomography, to gain a deeper understanding of protein dynamics in response to ligand binding and enzymatic reactions. The insights derived from this research will inform the design of more effective therapeutics for various diseases. Additionally, the project involves exploring the roles of organelles in cellular function and disease, with the goal of developing novel microscope technology integrating nanofluidics to enable high-resolution imaging of organelles in live cells.

								This project encompasses a diverse range of works, including poster presentations, talks, and publications. It aims to address important topics such as viral oncogenesis, Golgi apparatus dysfunction, and ribozyme mechanisms. Key achievements include presentations at prestigious conferences, such as the AACR-JCA Joint Conference and Cells 2023, as well as keynote speeches at Chemistry 2022 and Cancer Webinar 2022. Furthermore, the project has resulted in several publications in reputable journals, such as Viruses, Preprints, ResearchGate, and the International Journal of Molecular Science, covering topics such as host-pathogen interactions, organelle structural biology, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase dynamics, and epitope-based vaccines.

								Overall, this project is dedicated to advancing the fields of biology, biochemistry, microbiology, and immunology through the dissemination of our findings, ultimately contributing to the development of novel therapies for diseases such as cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and infectious diseases.<br>

								<b>Project I: Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP)</b><br>
								<u>Title</u>: Interleukin-17 Production in CNS by Infiltrating T Cells and Glial Cells in the HIV-1-Infected Brain<br>
								<u>Summary</u>: Despite effective combined anti-retroviral therapy (cART) for HIV-1-infected individuals, neurocognitive complications persist in patients, leading to negative impacts on daily functioning. The central nervous system (CNS) is affected in multiple ways during HIV infection, as HIV-infected cells cross the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) and initiate events causing CNS damage and neurocognitive problems. This study aims to investigate the role of interleukin-17 (IL-17) in HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), as IL-17 can disrupt the BBB. The researchers will analyze brain specimens and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from HAND patients with HIV encephalitis (HIVE) and compare them to samples from HIV-infected individuals with normal cognition (NC). The hypothesis is that IL-17A will be found in subcortical structures, specifically in the medium-spiny neurons of the basal ganglia and interneurons in the hippocampus, and that astrocytic secretion of the TH17 cell chemokine (CCL20) and cytokine (IL-17) will be detected in CSF samples of HAND patients with HIVE.
