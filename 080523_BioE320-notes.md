Pixel size: 0.4 A/pix
45 electrons 
45 frames

K3 counting 
Voltage (kV): 300 .. 200? 
Amplitude contrast: 0.1 (Wah: phase shift psi gamma term, cosin term, 0.8 - .12 % set to be 0.1 10% -> rigoursly curious talk to him)

Motion Correction

Relion's own implementaiton 

Gain-reference image: leave blank if already gain-corrected 

Bfactor: 150

Group frames: 1 
Binning factor: 1

Camera references 2 
noise level from camera
expose the elctron to the camera w/o any sample -> what would be the noise be statical noise of the electron. 

Gain-reference is a dark image -> add file here. or leave blank. 

CTF Estimation 

CTFFIND-4.1 
Default parameters 
dir to exe 
Min defocus: 5000 
Max defocus: 50000
Defocus step size: 500

(Empire metadata -> deposition page)

oxidation can become more rapid : oxidation is not as rapid .
500 micron 1 becomes 0 

50000/ 55000 differences

0.5 um -> 5000 A 
0.1 um could be different
oxidation is not as rapid .

what is the variation of (oxidation?) defocus with change in step size ? 

Particle Picking and Extraction 

Manual picking (biased) 
Pick ~1000 paritcles to generate templates 

Template-free autopicking (unbiased) 
Relion: Laplacian-Of-Gaussian (LoG) <-- start here
CryoSPARC: Blob Picking

Template-based autopicking (biased, false positive)

Topaz (CNN) picking* [cryoSPARC]

Ideal box size: 1.5x - 2x of particle size 

Box[Å] = MaxDefocus / 25 * BestPossibleResolution

Wah: why is the image cloudy? crowded? dont want them so close. to few particles could take forever. trade-off. optimize sample may need to keep in mind. Goldilock hypothesis. "Just right" embedding when suffieciently close. not too diluted. optimize parameters... ? EMAN is good to pick particles. 

RNA particle .. 15 Å stuck for 1 year and a half. Difficult project not crappy project. 

Rod shaped... looks like line but not when rotated. plane. XYZ. don't see the orientation variable as contaminant. 

Fringes contain information. pick larger particles to include more information. optimize.

LoG Autopicking

External diameter ~120 Å
Internal diameter ~80 Å

Particle Extration 

Rescale particles if it takes more than an hour. (iteration?)

After 2D classification re-extract particles w/o rescaling 

Ex
Parcile box size (pix): 480

<<Box size>>


Cluster similar particles 
Remove junk particles 
Perred oritentation?
Heterogeneity? 

* Relion iterations should take minutes, not hours (rescale your particles during Extration)
* Subset selection to select best classes

Ex.
Number of classes: 50 
Number of iterations: 25
Mask diameter: 168
Mask individual particles with zeros? Yes
Limit resolution E-step to (A): -1 

Wah: " keep in mind the class. there could be different nubmers. 100 particles of that orientation. the one next to it 350 particles. 

what is the crieteria? to make ranking.. 

different classes for all different orientatiaons. all in 3D space. what is the distribution of all andgles and class averages? "

iterative process (something from nothing, to something else)

Iterate until covergence 

Different software packages provide a number of strategies for intial reconstruction generation based on several principle

These include 
(i) specimen tilting methods,
(ii) common lines-based methods, (sinograph real space, etc)
(iii) random (visualization) initialization methods.

Tilting methods can be used to determine the handedness of the molecule under study, while common lines and random initialization do not provide this information.

## Validation of CryoEM Map

* Assure No Over-Refinement

* Tilted Pair image (revisit methodology here*)

* Characteristic structure features 

Cross validation with NMR and CryoEM 

"Who validates who?" 

Iceman: Randomize the face of the image of the resolution. Gaussian of a Gaussian distribution. Randomize the face to 7 Angstroms. nothing beyond 7 Angstroms is real. Reconstruction should go down to 7 A. 

Use phase randomization method of the raw fundamental images
